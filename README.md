# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

This project was created to analyze and create visualizations for all major data from January to early May of 2019 for PyBer, a ride-sharing company. The data includes the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. 

## Results

Based  on city type, the data showed an overall direct relationship between total rides, total drivers, and total fares, and showed an inverse relationship for average fare per ride and average fare per driver.

User knowledge of ride-sharing services and basic economics lead us to expect an increase in price based on decreased demand, increased distance, and driver availability. In larger cities and urban areas, the number of drivers is about 30 times greater than in rural areas, which translates to an increased relative demand. In fact, there are so many drivers in the urban area that at any given time, many drivers are not contracted, as shown by the contrast between the total number of rides and the total number of drivers. Prices are likely also increased in rural areas based on the distance between destinations. At a glance, the line chart shows exactly what's expected: an overall higher volume in total fares for urban areas, lowest volume for rural areas, with suburban falling in between.

Further analysis would have to be performed to truly identify trends based on time of year or even week, as four months-worth of data can't provide the full context. 

## Summary

Based on the above results, I have the following recommendations:

1. Focus recruitment marketing resources in rural areas to to increase the number of available drivers at a given time, while decreasing recruitment marketing in urban areas. (This recommendation would be highly influenced by turnover rates of contracted employees.)
2. Place a cap on fare to keep the service affordable in rural areas. This would make it more accessible to those who may be living in underserved service areas while still allowing for profit. 
3. Increase user-facing marketing efforts across the board, but particularly in urban areas, focusing on the services affordability and short wait times based on driver availability.
